        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>With an ever-growing enthusiasm and curiosity for software engineering, I am excited to enter the industry and begin my journey on the path to becoming a full-stack web developer.</p>
        <p>Since completing the General Assembly Immersive software engineering course, I believe I have built a solid foundation of key programming skills that I can take into the world of development.</p>
        <p>I’m eager to prove myself and put these teachings into practice in an environment that encourages cooperative and creative thinking, kickstarting a fresh and prosperous venture into coding.</p>
        <p>Reaffirmed and igniting my passion for coding, the Software Engineering course opened my eyes to the potential of these new-found practical skill-sets. I continue to gain confidence in my own abilities as I become more familiar and comfortable with the programming platform.</p>
        <p>Now my vision and enthusiasm for this new career path have become clear; I can’t wait to get stuck into a subject that I know I enjoy, building a career in an industry I intend to thrive in. </p>
